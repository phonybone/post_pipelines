<h2>RNA-Seq Pipeline Help</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of the RNA-Seq pipeline is to determine gene expression of
a given biological sample after it has been sequenced by a
Solexa/Illumina (or similar) sequencer.  It transforms the generated
output file of Illumina's ELAND processing pipeline into a file that
maps genes to expression levels as measured in "Reads per
Kilobase-Million" (RPKM).  To do so it uses the ERANGE software suite
developed by the Wold lab (Caltech).  More information about ERANGE
can be found 
<a href='http://woldlab.caltech.edu/html/rnaseq'>here</a>.</p>

<h3>Launching Pipelines</h3>
<p>
Access to the RNA-Seq pipeline at ISB is through the Slimseq website.
Once a sample is sequenced and the ELAND computation pipeline has
completed, it is available for post-processing by the RNA-Seq
pipeline.  Each sample has a page from which the pipeline can be
launched, accessible from the the 'edit' page for that sample.
</p><p>
Additionally, multiple samples can be processed through the RNA-Seq
pipeline simaltaneously by using Slimseq's Search utility.  To do so,
perform a search in the normal manner.  When the results are
displayed, click the checkbox next to each sample of interest and then
click the "RNA Seq Pipeline" button at the bottom of the page.  Only
pipelines for "compatible" samples may be launched simaltaneously.  In
order to be compatible, samples must a) have been prepared with the
RNA Seq sample prep kit; b) come from the same organism; and c) have
the same read lengths. 
<p></p>
Once the "launch" page is visible, you may alter the default
parameters used in running the RNA Seq pipeline.  There parameters
currently relate to the alignment portion of the pipeline, but more
may be added in the future.
<p></p>
Once the parameters are set as desired, click the "Launch Pipeline" at
the bottom, and the pipelines will be launched.  In general, there
will be one pipeline launched per sample, but if a sample was spread
over more than one flow cell lane during sequencing, there will be one
pipeline job launched for each flow cell lane (ie, there may be two or
more pipeline jobs per sample).
</p>
<h3>Results Page</h3>
<p>
When each pipeline job starts and finishes, email is sent to the user.
The email address can be changed if desired before the jobs are
launched.
<p></p>
In the case of pipeline errors, email will also be sent to the user.
If you receive such an email, it is best to <a
href='mailto:vcassen@systemsbiology.org'>contact the pipeline
administrator</a> to resolve the problem.  
<p></p>
If the pipeline is successful in its completion, it will be visible on
the website.  To access a sample's pipeline(s), return to the launch
page.  For each sample, there will be a link to any pipelines that
have run for that sample, indicating the pipeline's status.  When the
status is 'Finished', the output of the pipeline will be available on
the pipeline's webpage.
<p></p>
The results of each pipeline job consist of a file that contains the
mapping between genes and their expression levels found in the
sample.  That file is a tab-delimited file, and it's location in the
filesystem is displayed on the pipeline's page.  Each line of the file
lists one gene (identified by it's locuslink identifier and symbol),
the length of the mRNA transcript, and an expression measurement (in
RPKM).

<h3>Projects, Studies, Experiments, and Samples</h3> 

<p>An additional means of organizing your samples has been added to
Slimseq, in conjunction with the RNA Seq pipeline.  Under each
project, and number of studies may be added, and under each study, and
number of experiments may be added.  Each experiment, in turn, may
have related samples assigned to it.  For any experiment, RNA Seq
pipelines for all (or some) of the samples assigned to that experiment
may launched simaltaneously.
</p><p>
To add studies to a project, navigate to that project "edit" page, and
click on the "Add a new study" page.  Fill out the presented form and
click "Create".  The project's edit page will be displayed again, but
now the new study will be evident.  Clicking on the study's link will
allow you to add experiments to the study in the same manner.
</p><p>
To add samples to an experiment, navigate to the experiments "edit"
page, and click the "Manage Samples" link.  This page will show all
samples accessible to the user, even if they are currently assigned to
a different experiemnt.  The user adds a sample to the current
experiment by clicking the radio button in the "Owned by Current
Experiment" column, removing it from the "Unassigned" column or the
"Owned by Other Experiment" column.  It is thus possible to "steal"
samples from one experiment to another, but as only samples owned by
the user are displayed it is assumed that this is permissable.
</p><p>
Once samples are assigned to experiments satisfactorily, click the
"Update" button to make the changes permanent, and the experiment's
edit page will be again displayed.  Note the "RNA Seq Pipeline" link
on this page, which will take the user to the pipeline launch page
described earlier.
</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<h4>The "Launch RNA Seq Pipeline" button is disabled.
<p>If the launch button is disabled, it means that all of the samples
listed cannot be run together in the pipeline.  Although there are
checkboxes next to each pipeline on the launch page, unclicking
incompatible samples will not result in the launch button becoming
enabled (that may be a future feature, however).  Instead, you must go
back to the search page and unclick the offending samples there, then
re-click that page's "launch" button.
</p>
<h3>My pipeline job failed</h3>
<p>In this case, it is probably best to <a

administrator</a>.
